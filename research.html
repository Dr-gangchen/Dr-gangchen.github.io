<p><b>Fundamental challenges: </b> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are widely used in our industrial and economic world, such as intelligent transportation systems and smart factories, which have brought a lot of convenience to our lives, but the design of cyber-physical systems is still a very difficult task and requires more researchers' efforts. The problems to be solved urgently in cyber-physical system design mainly include lack of   requirements, difficulty in verification, and lack of efficient algorithms.</p>
<li><b>Lack of   requirements:</b> In traditional formal methods, human experts can use linear temporal logic (LTL)  and its variants, e.g., computation tree logic (CTL), signal temporal logic (STL), and metric temporal logic (MTL), to mathematically explain what the system is supposed to do and then such specifications can be checked against the behaviours of the system. However, as CPS are becoming increasingly complex (e.g., many CPS are equipped with artificial intelligence- and/or machine-learning-based components), it is quite challenging to come up with a high-quality specifications even for domain experts (actually such a challenge is well known even for application domains in which formal methods have found considerable success). </li>
 <li><b>Difficulty in verification:</b>CPS usually are combination of many subsystems. The verification of such systems will come across state space explosion problem, making the application of standard verification approaches substantially less effective.  The lack of verifiability causes safety and security concerns, hence it is imperative to build cost-effective tools to verify such systems.</li>
