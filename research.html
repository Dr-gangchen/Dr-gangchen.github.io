<p><b>Fundamental challenges: </b> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are widely used in our industrial and economic world, such as intelligent transportation systems and smart factories, which have brought a lot of convenience to our lives, but the design of cyber-physical systems is still a very difficult task and requires more researchers' efforts. The problems to be solved urgently in cyber-physical system design mainly include lack of   high level knwledge, difficulty in verification, and lack of efficient algorithms.</p>
<li><b>Lack of   high level knwledge:</b> In traditional formal methods, human experts can use linear temporal logic (LTL)  and its variants, e.g., computation tree logic (CTL), signal temporal logic (STL), and metric temporal logic (MTL), to mathematically explain what the system is supposed to do and then such high level knwledge can be checked against the behaviours of the system. However, as CPS are becoming increasingly complex (e.g., many CPS are equipped with artificial intelligence- and/or machine-learning-based components), it is quite challenging to come up with a high-quality high level knwledge even for domain experts (actually such a challenge is well known even for application domains in which formal methods have found considerable success). </li>
 <li><b>Difficulty in verification:</b>CPS usually are combination of many subsystems. The verification of such systems will come across state space explosion problem, making the application of standard verification approaches substantially less effective.  The lack of verifiability causes safety and security concerns, hence it is imperative to build cost-effective tools to verify such systems.</li>

  <h3>Formal Interpretation of Cyber-Physical System Performance with Temporal Logic</h3>
   <h3>Paper Source: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23335777.2018.1510857">Publication</a></h3>
  <p>
    The inherent and increasing complexity of many cyber-physical systems (CPSs) makes it challenging for human users or designers to comprehend and interpret their performance. This issue, without proper attention paid, may lead to unwanted and even catastrophic consequences, particularly with safety-critical CPSs. This paper presents a new methodology of enabling (i) a human to interrogate a CPS by inquiring with questions written in formal logic and (ii) the CPS to interpret its performance precisely in the context of the inquiry. This formal interpretation problem is first formulated as temporal logic inference problem, which, aided by the concept of robustness degree, can be converted into an optimization problem with probably approximately correct solutions. A new Gaussian-process-based active learning algorithm is then proposed to address the potential computational budget issue arising from solving the optimization problem. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a detailed case study on automotive mechatronic design is provided to showcase the proposed formal interpretation methodology. </p>

  <h3>Temporal-logic-based Semantic Fault Diagnosis with Time-series Data from Industrial Internet of Things</h3>
   <h3>Paper Source: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9059032">Publication</a></h3>
  <p>
    The maturity of sensor network technologies has facilitated the emergence of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which has collected an increasing volume of data. Converting these data into actionable intelligence for fault diagnosis is key to, e.g., reducing unscheduled downtime and performance degradation. This paper formalizes a problem called semantic fault diagnosis--to construct the formal specifications of faults directly from data collected from IIoT-enabled systems. The specifications are written as signal temporal logic formulas, which can be easily interpreted by humans. To tackle the issue of the combinatorial explosion which arises, we propose an algorithm that combines ideas from agenda-based searching and imitation learning to train a policy that searches formulas in a strategic order. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, which is further solved with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Our algorithm is applied to time series data collected from an IIoT-enabled iron-making factory. The results show empirically that our proposed algorithm is both scalable to the size of the data set  and interpretable, therefore allowing human users to take actions for, e.g., predictive maintenance.

  <h3>Formal Language Generation for Fault Diagnosis with Spectral Logic via Adversarial Training</h3>
   <h3>Paper Source: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6934964">Publication</a></h3>
  <p>
    Fault diagnosis with formal languages can be performed in an interpretable way.  However, traditional formal languages cannot deal with noisy environments. Additionally, finding the optimal formal language for fault diagnosis is still a challenge due to the sparse   reward issue.    This paper presents a novel method to find  formal languages, written with signal spectral logic (SSL), to describe the fault behaviours among frequency domain for fault diagnosis.  The formal language defined by SSL is robust to noise, acts as the fault diagnoser, and provides interpretabilities for human operators. Moreover,  the fault diagnoser construction  procedure has been formulated as a language generation process and an adversarial training technique is used to find the optimal formal language and avoid sparse reward issue existing in language generation problems.  Some experiments with real rolling element bearing data and simulated signals demonstrate  that our method is able to find formal languages to diagnose faults efficiently and accurately under noisy environments.  </p>

  <h3> Frequency-temporal-logic-based bearing fault diagnosis and fault interpretation using Bayesian optimization with Bayesian neural networks</h3>
   <h3>Paper Source: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S088832702030337X">Publication</a></h3>
  <p>
    Rolling element bearings are widely used components in modern rotary machines, and accurate diagnosis and interpretation for faults of bearings are significant for equipment maintenance. This paper introduces a fault diagnosis method with a formal specification language, which overcomes the difficulty of understanding the decision process of fault diagnosis. The formal specification is written with a novel formal language, called frequency-temporal-logic, defining the time-frequency properties of time series signals, which not only is a classifier to diagnose the faults but also gives interpretations for the fault signals with its semantics. To find an optimal description for the fault signals, the Bayesian optimization with Bayesian neural networks has been utilized to infer the structure and parameters of the formal specification. The semantics of frequency-temporal-logic then gives the fault interpretation. Moreover, the quantitative semantics for the formal language is defined based on a novel satisfaction metric, which has a noise resistance property. Analysis of the proposed method shows that the formal description can deal with noisy signals and variable speed operations of the bearings. Finally, comparison experimental results indicate the proposed method can obtain high fault diagnosis accuracy.  </p>
