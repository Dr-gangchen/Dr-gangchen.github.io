<p><b>Fundamental challenges: </b> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are widely used in our industrial and economic world, such as intelligent transportation systems and smart factories, which have brought a lot of convenience to our lives, but the design of cyber-physical systems is still a very difficult task and requires more researchers' efforts. The problems to be solved urgently in cyber-physical system design mainly include lack of   high level knwledge, difficulty in verification, and lack of efficient algorithms.</p>
<li><b>Lack of   high level knwledge:</b> In traditional formal methods, human experts can use linear temporal logic (LTL)  and its variants, e.g., computation tree logic (CTL), signal temporal logic (STL), and metric temporal logic (MTL), to mathematically explain what the system is supposed to do and then such high level knwledge can be checked against the behaviours of the system. However, as CPS are becoming increasingly complex (e.g., many CPS are equipped with artificial intelligence- and/or machine-learning-based components), it is quite challenging to come up with a high-quality high level knwledge even for domain experts (actually such a challenge is well known even for application domains in which formal methods have found considerable success). </li>
 <li><b>Difficulty in verification:</b>CPS usually are combination of many subsystems. The verification of such systems will come across state space explosion problem, making the application of standard verification approaches substantially less effective.  The lack of verifiability causes safety and security concerns, hence it is imperative to build cost-effective tools to verify such systems.</li>

  measurement range without loss resolution. By applying a fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controlled programmable gain amplifier array to produce a reference signal, which can adjust itself according to LVDT's core position, the conditioning circuit has ensured the signal to analog-to-digital converter varying in a very small interval over full-scale operating range. Thus, the sensitivity of the measurement system can be improved without losing measurement range. The simulation result demonstrated that the proposed circuit has solved the contradiction between resolution and range, which usually occurs in weak signal detection. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio has been ameliorated greatly. Additionally, the DSP-based signal conditioner, which utilizes the self-adaptive circuit, demonstrates the performance of the novel design and nanometer precision is obtained in a wide range.
