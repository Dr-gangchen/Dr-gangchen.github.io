   This project studies a novel time–frequency representation method—adaptive non-parametric short-time Fourier transform (ANSTFT), together with its application to the echolocation signal analysis. By rotating the signal in the analysis window, the local instantaneous frequency has been reset to parallel to the time axis. Then the high frequency and time resolution have been achieved with the mono-frequency signal simultaneously. To find the optimal rotating angle of the local signal, an iterative approximation algorithm has been utilized, which makes the ANSTFT a non-parametric data driving method and have the better generalization ability than the conventional adaptive STFT. Moreover, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the aforementioned characteristics and the application of ANSTFT to echolocation signal analysis demonstrates its validity.    <strong>Technologies:</strong> Self-adaptive Circit, Linear Variable Differential Transformer.

    A self-adaptive circuit for the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) has been developed to enhance its nanometer measurement range without loss resolution. By applying a fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controlled programmable gain amplifier array to produce a reference signal, which can adjust itself according to LVDT's core position, the conditioning circuit has ensured the signal to analog-to-digital converter varying in a very small interval over full-scale operating range. Thus, the sensitivity of the measurement system can be improved without losing measurement range. The simulation result demonstrated that the proposed circuit has solved the contradiction between resolution and range, which usually occurs in weak signal detection. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio has been ameliorated greatly. Additionally, the DSP-based signal conditioner, which utilizes the self-adaptive circuit, demonstrates the performance of the novel design and nanometer precision is obtained in a wide range.

    This project introduces a wrapper method, namely cosine similarity measure support vector machines (CSMSVM), to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features during classifier construction by introducing the cosine distance into support vector machines (SVM). Traditionally, feature selection approaches typically extract features and learn SVM parameters independently or in the attribute space, which might result in a loss of information related to classification process or lead to the increase of classification error when introduce the kernel SVM. The proposed CSMSVM framework, however, jointly performs feature selection, SVM parameter learning and remove low relevance features by optimizing the shape of an anisotropic RBF kernel in feature space. Moreover, the Bayesian interpretation of the novel methodology reveals its Bayesian character, which builds the proposed method on solid theory foundation, and the iteration algorithm, which is proposed to optimize the feature weight, has achieved to maximize the maximum a posterior (MAP). Comparing the novel method with well-known feature selection techniques with experiments, CSMSVM outperformed the other methodologies in improving the pattern recognition accuracy with fewer features. <p>

    This topic presents a Chirplet Wigner-Ville Distribution (CWVD) that is free for cross-term that usually occurs in Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD). By transforming the signal with frequency rotating operators, several mono-frequency signals without intermittent are obtained, WVD is applied to the rotated signals that is cross-term free, then some frequency shift operators corresponding to the rotating operator are utilized to relocate the signal’s instantaneous frequencies (IFs). The operators’ parameters come from the estimation of the IFs which are approached with a polynomial functions or spline functions. What’s more, by analysis of error, the main factors for the performance of the novel method have been discovered and an effective signal extending method based on the IFs estimation has been developed to improve the energy concentration of WVD. The excellent performance of the novel method was manifested by applying it to estimate the IFs of some numerical signals and the echolocation signal emitted by the Large Brown Bat.  </p>

      This project studied an architectural framework of an expert system  for anti-hijacking and describes the design and development of case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) expert system. The system’ s knowledge comes  from  the  statistics for the  previous cases,  expert  experience  and  the art  of  war.  CBR  and  RBR serial reasoning  are used in the   system.  First by matching cases to  seek results, if not,  goes to the universal rule-based reasoning  which using a Hopfield neural network model  which combined with  confidence interval  technology to solve nonlinear programming problems,  then  the  logic  statement  which based on the  expert experience and  the  art of war  will be used to perfect the solution.  Then  a  man-machine  interface  will  output  the  solution. The  results  show  the  system  is consistent with  the  actual, and can provide some help to the police.    </p>
