    This topic presents a Chirplet Wigner-Ville Distribution (CWVD) that is free for cross-term that usually occurs in Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD). By transforming the signal with frequency rotating operators, several mono-frequency signals without intermittent are obtained, WVD is applied to the rotated signals that is cross-term free, then some frequency shift operators corresponding to the rotating operator are utilized to relocate the signal’s instantaneous frequencies (IFs). The operators’ parameters come from the estimation of the IFs which are approached with a polynomial functions or spline functions. What’s more, by analysis of error, the main factors for the performance of the novel method have been discovered and an effective signal extending method based on the IFs estimation has been developed to improve the energy concentration of WVD. The excellent performance of the novel method was manifested by applying it to estimate the IFs of some numerical signals and the echolocation signal emitted by the Large Brown Bat.  </p>

      This project studied an architectural framework of an expert system  for anti-hijacking and describes the design and development of case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) expert system. The system’ s knowledge comes  from  the  statistics for the  previous cases,  expert  experience  and  the art  of  war.  CBR  and  RBR serial reasoning  are used in the   system.  First by matching cases to  seek results, if not,  goes to the universal rule-based reasoning  which using a Hopfield neural network model  which combined with  confidence interval  technology to solve nonlinear programming problems,  then  the  logic  statement  which based on the  expert experience and  the  art of war  will be used to perfect the solution.  Then  a  man-machine  interface  will  output  the  solution. The  results  show  the  system  is consistent with  the  actual, and can provide some help to the police.    </p>
